## Starting a new Translation

The Vue documentation has recently undergone a major revision, so translations in other languages are still missing or work-in-progress.

We welcome community efforts to provide more translations. Translation efforts are managed in the [vuejs-translations](https://github.com/vuejs-translations/) GitHub organization. If you are interested in contributing, please check out the [Translation Guidelines](https://github.com/vuejs-translations/guidelines/blob/main/README.md) to get started.
